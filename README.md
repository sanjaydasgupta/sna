For now, check out the Google code project [Scala Native Access](https://code.google.com/p/scala-native-access/)

If you just need to use JNA and are having trouble in using [struct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language))s from Scala, check out [JNA4Scala](https://github.com/sanjaydasgupta/JNA4Scala).
